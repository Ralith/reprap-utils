==============
gcdump
==============

This tool is intended to be used to send gcode to a RepRap machine listening on a serial port.  It can accept input either from a file, passed as the last argument, or, if the file is "-" or unspecified, gcode is read from the standard input, appropriate for minimal interactive use as well as input piped in from a file or a tool which generates gcode.

Please note that serial speed defaults to 19200; you will receive unpredictable results if your RepRap operates with a different serial speed and you do not explicitly specify it.

Examples:

# Dumps the file minimug.gcode using serial linespeed 38400 and automatically determining the correct serial port
gcdump -s 38400 -f ./minimug.gcode

# Dumps the file minimug.gcode using default serial linespeed and
# printing all communications to standard output, stripping unnecessary
# gcode before transmitting.
gcdump -c -v /dev/ttyUSB0 < ./minimug.gcode

# Dumps the file minimug.gcode without printing anything to
# standard output.  Note that errors will still be printed to
# standard error if necessary.
cat ./minimug.gcode | gcdump -q /dev/ttyUSB0

# Interactively dumps the single command G1 X10 Y10 Z0 and exits
# safely.
gcdump /dev/ttyUSB0
G1 X10 Y10 Z0

=============
gcgen
=============

This tool provides a simple, easy-to-use interface to generate gcode for maintenance and testing purposes, appropriate for writing to file for use as, for example, a Skeingorge header, or being piped directly into a RepRap machine through the use of a tool such as gcdump.

Examples:

# Produces gcode to zero all three axes and linear-move to 50,0,0
gcgen -z xyz -l 50::

# Produces gcode to linear-move to 12,17,42, then to 12,20,42.
# (or 12,3,0 in absolute mode) (assumes starting at 0,0,0)
gcgen -l 12,17,42 -l ,3,

# Instructs a machine connected on /dev/ttyUSB0 to cease
# extruding and shut off the heater.
gcgen -e off -t 0 | gcdump /dev/ttyUSB0

# Instructs an automatically detected machine to begin warming
# to ABS extrusion temperature and zero the X and Y axes.
gcgen -t 240 -z xy | gcdump
